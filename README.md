# Group Up
Social media is increasing exponentially in the lives of children, teenagers and adults. It allows family and friends to stay connected through the internet without the need to physically move to each other. Because of this ease of access, social media has been growing immensely in popularity and doesn't seem to be stopping any time soon. To accommodate this rising number of users many companies are creating more platforms, each with their own creative twist. 

In this project we intend to create a platform for hobbyists to come together, share or learn more about their hobbies, whatever they may be. One example of this type of platform is [meetup](https://www.meetup.com)​. On this website you can create events for people to sign up and meet. 

We believe we could bring people closer together by giving them a way of joining or hosting an event with other people and ultimately enjoy their hobby to the fullest, all the while in the presence of other like minded people.

# Scenarios
Main scenario:
- The main scenario relies on the functionality to create/join events. Each new user will have to register on the platform providing basic information (name, birthdate, etc), his favorite hobbies and location. After the registration, he will be able to create events. In order to do this he will have to select the “Create Event” button, this will open a window dedicated to this functionality. The user will then have to select the type of activity that he wants to create (hiking, cycling, jogging, etc) and the type of access (public or private, where only users with the event link will be able to access). Afterwards, he will be able to name the event, set its date and choose its type of schedule (routine,one-time or workshop). After the event is created, other users can see it and join it. Once an event is created our platform will convert the address given by the event host onto a map for other users to see it. The user will also be able to click on the address url to open google maps and follow the directions to the chosen place.

Secondary scenarios:
- After the event ended the user will choose a rating for the event, from 1 to 5 (star rating) by clicking on the amount of stars. Then he has the option to leave a comment.
- If the user wishes he is able to sort events by type, proximity and popularity by clicking the “Sort” button.
- The user can utilize the search bar to look for other users by writing their name.
- When visiting another user’s profile you can click a button to add him as a friend.
- By clicking on the Chat icon the user will see a friends list popping up and is then able to click a friend to chat with.
