# Group Up
Social media is increasing exponentially in the lives of children, teenagers and adults. It allows family and friends to stay connected through the internet without the need to physically move to each other. Because of this ease of access, social media has been growing immensely in popularity and doesn't seem to be stopping any time soon. To accommodate this rising number of users, many companies are creating more platforms, each with their own creative twist. In this project we intend to create a platform for hobbyists to come together, share or learn more about their hobbies, whatever they may be. One example of this type of platform is [meetup](https://www.meetup.com)â€‹. On this website you can create events for people to sign up and meet. 
We believe we could bring people closer together by giving them a way of joining or hosting an event with other people and ultimately enjoy their hobby to the fullest, all the while in the presence of other like minded people.
